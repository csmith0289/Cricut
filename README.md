# Cricut Install Multiple Fonts In A Single Go.
Useful for bundles from CreativeFabrica / Design Bundles.

All you need to do is Download the .bat file
move this file to the directory where all the font folders are, or create a new file, name it whatever you want, but it needs .bat as the file extension.
Edit the file content to contain the lines within the .bat file (Open In Raw).

It makes a new folder called AllFonts
Then for every folder within the same directory this .bat file is, it will copy all the content into the new AllFont folder.
Once complete, all you need to do is go into the AllFonts folder.
Control + A to select all the files, Right Click and then Install.

Thats all the fonts installed.
You can then delete the folders and keep the Zip file all zipped up.
